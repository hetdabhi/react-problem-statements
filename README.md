‚òëÔ∏è Setup Tasks

1. Set Up the Project:
   - Initialize a React project using Vite or Create React App.
   - Create a folder named `components` to store reusable components.

---

‚òëÔ∏è Building a Simple Portfolio Page

2. Create a Simple JSX Element:
   - A `Header.jsx` component with your name, tagline (e.g., "Aspiring Software Engineer"), and navigation links to sections such as About, Projects, and Contact.

3. Create a Complex JSX Element:
   - Extend the portfolio header to include:
     - A profile picture.
     - Social media icons (LinkedIn, GitHub) as clickable links.

4. Add Comments in JSX:
   - Comment various sections in `Header.jsx` to explain their functionality.

5. Render HTML Elements to the DOM:
   - Use `ReactDOM.render` or `createRoot` to render the `Header` component.

---

‚òëÔ∏è Building a Project Showcase

6. Define an HTML Class in JSX:
   - A `ProjectCard.jsx` component that displays a project title, description, and a "View More" button.

7. Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags:
   - Use an `img` tag to display a project screenshot in the `ProjectCard` component.

---

‚òëÔ∏è Building a Weather App

8. Create a Stateless Functional Component:
   - A `WeatherInfo.jsx` component that displays props like `city`, `temperature`, and `description`.

9. Create a React Component:
   - A `WeatherApp.jsx` component that fetches weather data from an API and passes it to `WeatherInfo`.

10. Render Nested Components:
    - Render multiple `WeatherInfo` components inside `WeatherApp` for different cities.

---

‚òëÔ∏è Student Attendance Tracker

11. Create a Stateful Component:
    - A `AttendanceTracker.jsx` component to track student attendance.

12. Render State in the User Interface:
    - Display the total number of present and absent students.

13. Set State with `this.setState`:
    - Add a button to mark students as present or absent and update the state.

---

## Building a To-Do List App

14. Bind 'this' to a Class Method:
    - A `TodoApp.jsx` class component to manage task additions and deletions.

15. Use State to Toggle an Element:
    - Add a toggle button to mark tasks as completed or not.

16. Write a Simple Counter:
    - Display the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.

---

‚òëÔ∏è Building a Student Feedback Form

17. Create a Controlled Form:
    - A `FeedbackForm.jsx` that captures name, email, and feedback message.

18. Pass State as Props to Child Components:
    - Pass the captured feedback to a `FeedbackCard.jsx` component to display feedback.

---

‚òëÔ∏è Building a Library Management System

19. Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component:
    - A `BookCard.jsx` component to display book details like title, author, and availability status.

20. Pass an Array as Props:
    - A `Library.jsx` component that renders a list of `BookCard` components.

21. Use Default Props:
    - Set default props in `BookCard` to handle missing details (e.g., missing book title).

22. Override Default Props:
    - Pass custom details to override the default props in `BookCard`.

---

‚òëÔ∏è Building a Blogging Platform

23. Use PropTypes to Define the Props:
    - Add PropTypes to a `BlogPost.jsx` component for validation (e.g., title, content, author).

24. Create a Controlled Input:
    - Create a form to add new blog posts, managing input fields with state.

25. Pass State as Props to Child Components:
    - Pass blog data to a `BlogList.jsx` component for displaying posts.

---

‚òëÔ∏è Building a Real-Time Chat App

26. Create a Component with Composition:
    - A `ChatApp.jsx` that uses components like `ChatHeader`, `MessageList`, and `MessageInput`.

27. Compose React Components:
    - Display multiple chat interfaces within the `ChatApp`.

28. Create a Stateful Component:
    - Store and update chat messages in the state.

29. Render State in the User Interface Another Way:
    - Use `map` function to dynamically render messages in the `MessageList`.
